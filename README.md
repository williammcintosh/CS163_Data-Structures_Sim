# CS163_Data-Structures_Sim

As a computer science tutor, I found that teaching data structures is more successfully through a visualizer. At Portland State University, we choose to teach data structures intentionally separate from object oriented programming including inheritance. This makes the process of teaching class object instantiating a little tricky. We get around needing inheritance by creating a single object in int main() for the purpose of temporarily holding the char * information that will then be copied into each object in the data structure.
